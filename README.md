### Description of the Project

In this project we are going to implement our version of the classic board game "Rush-Hour". The basic premise 
of the game is to guide a car out of a traffic jam by moving other cars which serve as blocking pieces on the 
puzzle board. The lesser the number of moves, the higher the score! Also, the user has to free the car within a certain time
limit. This is a level-based game with 4 levels of difficulty and 40 challenges, each presenting a new puzzle.

### Platform and Programming Language 

The programming language we have decided to use is Java which we will implement on Desktop using JavaFX and GUI.

### Build Instructions

First, make sure you have Java installed. Here's a simple [How To?](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html). Then, run the following commands:

1 - `$ git clone https://github.com/NaisilaPuka/rushHourByChainCoders.git`

2 - `$ cd rushHourByChainCoders/src/rushHour`
